# Gene-Circuit-ODE
This repository solves an Ordinary Differential Equation which interprets interaction of multiple genes using an interaction matrix and decay rate.
We are working on adapting ML for the pulse generator circuit design.
This is the initial code and the repo updation is still in progress.
